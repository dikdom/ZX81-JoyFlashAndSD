This directory contains the manufacture files.

- The **ZX81-FlashAndJoy-rev4-gerber.zip** file is the gerber file of the PCB. This is the file you have to upload to a PCB manufacture site to produce the PCBs.
- The _-BOM_ and _-PickAndPlace_ files are pcb assembly specific files for JLCPCB. I asked them to solder the SMD components to my PCB so I didn't have to bother with them, just with the TH components...
