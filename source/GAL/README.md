These are the source files of the GAL code. The .pld files were created and compiled with the ancient WinCUPL tool.

The naming of these files are from the era when I planned to have some 'Simple Expansion cart', this is why it is called SEXP..

ZX81-SEXP is for the left GAL (gal20v8) while the ZX81-SEXP-D22 is for the right GAL (gal22v10).

You can find the source, the test, the intermediate compile files and the final .jed files also here (sorry for the duplicate).

UPDATE: Two new .pld (and corresponding .jed) files were added. It turned out that not all ZX81 behaves the same. If you're experiences not starting cart, try the r41 jed files on the left GAL. In short the access window of the internal ROM is widened which causes some other ZX81 weird behaviour. So. One of the .jed files _should_ work... (Sorry)
