These are the source files of the GAL code. The .pld files were created and compiled with the ancient WinCUPL tool.

The naming of these files are from the era when I planned to have some 'Simple Expansion cart', this is why it is called SEXP..

ZX81-SEXP is for the left GAL (gal20v8) while the ZX81-SEXP-D22 is for the right GAL (gal22v10).

You can find the source, the test, the intermediate compile files and the final .jed files also here (sorry for the duplicate).
